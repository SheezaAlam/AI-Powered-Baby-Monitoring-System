## 📑 Overview  
AngelCam is an **AI-powered baby monitoring system** that uses object detection to identify and track babies in surveillance video footage. If a baby exits a defined safe zone, the system **raises an alert**. This solution is ideal for busy parents and can be integrated into nanny cams or smart surveillance systems.

## 🎯 Features  
- 🍼 Real-time **baby detection & tracking**  
- 🖼️ Define a **custom safe zone**  
- 🚨 Alert if baby moves outside the safe zone  
- 📊 Detection history & monitoring logs  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Model**: YOLOv5 (Object Detection)  
- **Dataset**: Baby Detection (Roboflow)  
- **Environment**: Google Colab (GPU Enabled)  

---

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Load the trained **YOLOv5 model**  
2. Stream video from webcam / surveillance feed  
3. Detect and track the baby inside the frame  
4. If the baby exits the **safe zone**, an **alert is triggered**
