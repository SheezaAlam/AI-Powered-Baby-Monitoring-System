# 👶 Baby Detection, Tracking & Alert System (YOLOv5 + YouTube Integration)

---

## 📌 Overview
This project is an **AI-powered baby monitoring system** built with **YOLOv5**.  
It can **detect, track, and alert** when a baby moves outside a **predefined safety zone**.  
The system supports **real-time monitoring, local video processing, and YouTube video input**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Custom-trained YOLOv5 model** for baby detection  
- ✅ **Live tracking & zone-based alerts**  
- ✅ **YouTube video integration** for remote footage analysis  
- ✅ **Google Colab compatibility** for quick setup  
- ✅ **Sound alerts** when baby leaves the safe zone

## 📊 Detection Box Colors
| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟦 Blue | Baby is **inside** the safety zone |
| 🟥 Red  | Baby is **outside** the safety zone (**Alert!**) |

## 🛠 Tech Stack
| Tool/Library | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Python 3** | Programming Language |
| **YOLOv5**   | Object Detection |
| **PyTorch**  | Deep Learning |
| **OpenCV**   | Video Processing |

## ⚙️ Setup & Usage (Google Colab)

### 1️⃣ Install YOLOv5
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
%cd yolov5
!pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2️⃣ Download YouTube Video

```python
from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

video_url = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_URL"
ydl_opts = {"format": "best[ext=mp4]", "outtmpl": "input_video.mp4"}
with YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
    ydl.download([video_url])
```

### 3️⃣ Run Detection with Alerts

```bash
python detect_and_alert.py --weights best.pt --source input_video.mp4
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Detect** – YOLOv5 identifies the baby in the frame.
2. **Track** – Object tracking keeps the baby in view across frames.
3. **Alert** – If the baby leaves the predefined safety zone, a sound alert is triggered.
