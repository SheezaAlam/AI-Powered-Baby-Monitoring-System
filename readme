## 📖 Overview  
**AngelCam** is an AI-powered baby monitoring system that uses **YOLOv5 object detection** to identify and track babies in real-time.  
If a baby exits a **user-defined safety zone**, the system immediately raises an alert.  

This solution is ideal for:  
- 🍼 Busy parents who want peace of mind.  
- 📹 Integration into nanny cams or smart surveillance systems.  
- 👶 AI-powered safety applications.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Real-time baby detection using YOLOv5.  
- ✅ Tracks movement inside a **custom safe zone**.  
- ✅ Alerts if the baby exits the zone.  
- ✅ Built with **Google Colab** for easy training & testing.  
- ✅ Dataset powered by **Roboflow**.
